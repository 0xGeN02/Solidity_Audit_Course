# Solidity Audit Course

This repository contains the code and resources for the Solidity Audit Course, a comprehensive guide to auditing Solidity smart contracts. The course is based on a video tutorial by Patrick Collins, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUWmJ86X_do&t=4386s)

## Structure

The workspace is divided into two main directories:

- `basic-sol-project/`: This directory contains a basic Solidity project, including source code, tests, and a Foundry configuration file.
- `security-and-auditing-full-course-s23/`: This directory contains additional resources for the course, including guidelines for asking and answering questions, a code of conduct, and a media kit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, clone this repository and navigate to the `basic-sol-project/` directory. From there, you can explore the source code and run the tests.
